            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
			<p>
			I'm a computational astrophysicist (kinda). I did my undergraduate studies at The Australian National University, with a major in Theoretical Physics, and specialising in Advanced Physics. I also have an Honours project in Astrophysics, and am currently figuring out what to do with all of that. 
            <!-- <h3>How am I?</h3>
